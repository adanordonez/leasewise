# Tenant-First Laws Section Redesign

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Current Issues:**
- Too technical (jurisdictions, code years, statutes)
- No guidance on what tenants actually need
- Assumes users know what to look for
- Legal jargon everywhere
- Not actionable

**Target User:**
- Tenant who doesn't know their rights
- Probably facing a specific issue
- Doesn't know legal terminology
- Needs quick, clear answers
- Wants to know "Can my landlord do this?"

## 💡 New Approach: Question-First Design

### **Landing Experience**

Instead of showing states and topics, start with **common tenant questions**:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Know Your Rights as a Tenant                      │
│  Get instant answers to common rental questions    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                    │
│  [📍 Your Location: Enter city or state]          │
│                                                    │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐     │
│  │ 🔍 What's your situation?                 │     │
│  │ E.g., "Can my landlord enter without     │     │
│  │ notice?" or "When do I get my deposit?"  │     │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘     │
│                                                    │
│  Or choose a common issue:                        │
│                                                    │
│  [💰 Security Deposit Issues]                     │
│  [🚪 Entry & Privacy Rights]                      │
│  [🔧 Repairs & Maintenance]                       │
│  [📝 Lease Breaking & Eviction]                   │
│  [💵 Rent Increases & Fees]                       │
│  [🏠 Habitability Issues]                         │
│                                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🎨 Proposed Design Elements

### **1. Smart Search with Plain English**

```tsx
// Examples auto-suggest as user types
<input 
  placeholder="Try: 'Can my landlord charge a pet fee?'"
  suggestions={[
    "Can my landlord enter without notice?",
    "When do I get my security deposit back?",
    "My landlord won't fix the heat",
    "Can I break my lease early?",
    "How much notice for rent increase?"
  ]}
/>
```

### **2. Issue-Based Categories (Not Legal Topics)**

Instead of:
- ❌ "Security Deposits"
- ❌ "Lease Termination"
- ❌ "Habitability Standards"

Use:
- ✅ "Getting Your Deposit Back" 💰
- ✅ "Breaking Your Lease Early" 🚪
- ✅ "Your Landlord Won't Make Repairs" 🔧
- ✅ "Privacy & Landlord Entry" 👁️
- ✅ "Unfair Fees & Charges" 💵
- ✅ "Eviction Defense" 🛡️

### **3. Question & Answer Format**

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 💰 Security Deposits in New York      │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                        │
│ ❓ When should I get my deposit back?  │
│ ✅ Within 14 days after you move out   │
│                                        │
│ ❓ Can they charge me for normal wear? │
│ ❌ No, only for damages beyond normal  │
│    wear and tear                       │
│                                        │
│ ❓ What if they don't return it?       │
│ 📋 You can sue for double the amount   │
│    plus court costs                    │
│                                        │
│ [View Full Details] [Related Issues]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **4. Visual Indicators**

- ✅ **Green checkmark**: What you CAN do / Your rights
- ❌ **Red X**: What landlord CANNOT do
- ⚠️ **Warning**: Important exceptions or conditions
- 💡 **Light bulb**: Pro tips
- 📋 **Document**: Action steps

### **5. Location-First (But Simple)**

   - ❌ "Pursuant to statute 123.45..."

4. **Action-oriented**
   - Always end with "What you can do"
   - Provide next steps
   - Link to resources

5. **Highlight key points**
   - Use emojis sparingly
   - Bold important facts
   - Use bullet points

### **Content Structure Template**

## 💡 Example Transformations

### **Before (Technical):**
```
Security Deposits
State: New York
Topic: Deposit Limits

NY RPL §7-103: Maximum security deposit shall
not exceed one month's rent for units subject
to rent stabilization...
```

### **After (Tenant-Friendly):**
```
💰 How much can my landlord charge for a deposit?

**In New York: Maximum 1 month's rent**

✅ YOUR RIGHTS:
• Deposit can't exceed 1 month's rent
• Must be in NY bank with your name on it
• You earn interest after 1 year

❌ LANDLORD CANNOT:
• Charge more than 1 month
• Use it as last month's rent
• Keep it without itemized damages

🎯 WHAT TO DO:
1. Get a receipt when you pay
2. Take photos on move-in day
3. Send landlord the photos by email

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
Do a walk-through with landlord and document
every scratch, stain, or issue before you unpack!

[📥 Download move-in checklist]
[💬 What about pet deposits?]
```

## ✨ Final Result

A laws section that:
- ✅ Speaks tenant language (not legal jargon)
- ✅ Starts with common problems (not statutes)
- ✅ Provides clear answers (not paragraphs of law)
- ✅ Gives action steps (not just information)
- ✅ Empowers tenants (knowledge = power)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (tenants research on phones)
- ✅ Actually helps people (that's the goal!)

**Remember:** The best legal resource is one that people
actually use and understand! 🎉
