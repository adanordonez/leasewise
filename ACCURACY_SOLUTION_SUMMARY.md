# ✅ ACCURACY SOLUTION - Summary

## 🎯 Problem

You reported:
1. ❌ **Hallucinations** - "Pages don't say what the output says"
2. ❌ **Broken links** - "Sometimes say page not found"
3. ❌ **Inaccurate** - "How can I double, triple, quadruple check?"

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **1. Removed "Find Legal Sources" Section**
- ✅ Removed from rights section (redundant with comprehensive table)
- ✅ Cleaned up UI

### **2. Created Multi-Layer Verification System**

#### **Layer 1: Get Legal Info** 📚
```
Use GPT-4o to extract ${state} renter laws
- 10 categories
- Real statute citations
- Real source URLs
```

#### **Layer 2: Fetch Real Pages** 📄
```
For each category:
- Fetch full page content with Jina AI
- Get 10,000+ characters of actual text
- Verify page exists and loads
```

#### **Layer 3: Verify Claims** 🔍
```
For each category:
- Send claim + full page to GPT-4o
- Ask: "Does this page support this claim?"
- Get verification score 0-100
- Only mark "verified" if score ≥ 70
```

#### **Layer 4: Show Verification Status** ✅
```
Users see:
- ✅ Green checkmark = Verified (page confirms)
- ⚠️ Amber warning = Unverified (couldn't confirm)
- All 10 categories show (even unverified)
- Transparent verification scores
```

---

## 🔍 How It Works

```
User clicks "Search Renter Laws"
         ↓
GPT-4o gets legal info for ${state}
         ↓
For each category:
  ├─ Fetch page with Jina AI
  ├─ Verify claim against page (GPT-4o)
  ├─ Get score 0-100
  └─ Mark as ✅ verified or ⚠️ unverified
         ↓
Show results with verification badges
```
