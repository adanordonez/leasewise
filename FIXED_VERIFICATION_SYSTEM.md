# ✅ FIXED: Simplified Verification System

## 🎯 What Changed

I've fixed the error and created a **simpler, working verification system** that:

1. ✅ **Uses standard OpenAI APIs** (not the experimental Responses API)
2. ✅ **Gets legal info from GPT-4o's training data**
3. ✅ **Verifies against actual web pages** with Jina AI
4. ✅ **Shows all results** but marks which are verified vs unverified
5. ✅ **No more crashes!**

---

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### **STEP 1: Get Legal Information** 📚

```
- Use GPT-4o with JSON mode
- Ask for ${state} renter laws for 10 categories
- Request real statute citations
- Request real government source URLs
- Personalize examples with lease context
```

**Result**: 10 legal categories with explanations, statutes, and source URLs

---

### **STEP 2: Verify Each One** 🔍

For each category:

```
1. Check if source URL exists
   └─ If no URL → Mark as "unverified" but keep it

2. Fetch page content with Jina AI
   └─ If page doesn't load → Mark as "unverified" but keep it

3. Send claim + page content to GPT-4o
   - Ask: "Does this page support this claim?"
   - Get verification score 0-100
   - Threshold: 70+ = verified
   └─ If score < 70 → Mark as "unverified" but keep it

4. Add to results with verification status
```

---

### **STEP 3: RAG Personalization** 🎯

If PDF is provided:
```
- Create RAG from lease PDF
- For VERIFIED categories only
- Personalize "example" with actual lease clauses
- Show "How it applies to your lease"
```
