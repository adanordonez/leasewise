# 🔍 RAG Console Logs - What to Expect

## ✅ What's Been Updated

I've integrated **RAG analysis** into the **ComprehensiveLegalTable** (the "Know Your Rights" table with 10 categories). Now the "Example" column will show **"How It Applies to Your Lease"** using RAG!

## 📋 Console Logs You'll See

When you click "Search Renter Laws for Your Area", watch the browser console for these logs:

### **Step 1: API Called**
```

For EACH of the 10 categories, you'll see:

## 🎯 What Each Log Means

### **📄 Extracted text from X pages**
- RAG has read your entire lease PDF
- Each page is now searchable
- X = number of pages in your lease

### **🔍 Analyzing how "Category Name" applies to the lease...**
- RAG is searching your lease for clauses about this topic
- Using embeddings to find relevant sections
- Will analyze top 3 most relevant lease clauses

### **Application: [text]**
- This is the personalized explanation
- Should mention YOUR specific amounts ($1,200, $2,400, etc.)
- Should mention YOUR specific dates
- Should compare YOUR lease with the law

### **Has Match: Yes/No**
- **Yes**: Found relevant clauses in your lease
- **No**: Your lease is silent on this topic (but law still applies)

## 🎨 What You'll See in the UI

The table's "Example" column will change from:

### **Before** (Generic)
```
Example:
If your rent is $1,000 and you pay a $2,000 deposit,
the landlord must return it within the legal timeframe.
```

### **After** (Personalized with RAG)
```
Example (How It Applies to You):
Your $2,400 security deposit (2x your $1,200 monthly rent)
must be returned within 45 days after your June 30, 2025
move-out date. Your lease states deposits are "refundable"
which complies with Illinois law.
```

**Notice the differences**:
- ✅ Uses YOUR actual rent: $1,200
- ✅ Uses YOUR actual deposit: $2,400
- ✅ Uses YOUR actual dates: June 30, 2025
- ✅ Quotes YOUR actual lease: "refundable"
- ✅ Compares with the law

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **"PDF URL: Not provided"**
**Problem**: No PDF URL passed to API
**Fix**: Make sure you're on the results page after analyzing a lease

### **"ℹ️ No PDF URL provided, using generic examples"**
**Problem**: PDF URL is missing
**Result**: Table will show generic examples instead of personalized

### **"⚠️ RAG analysis failed, returning generic examples"**
**Problem**: RAG crashed (PDF issue, memory, etc.)
**Result**: Table will fall back to generic examples
**Check**: Look for error message in console

### **Logs stop at "Analyzing X laws with RAG..."**
