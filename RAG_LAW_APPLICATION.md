# 🎯 RAG + Legal Search: "How It Applies to Your Lease"

## ✅ What's New

I've integrated **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** with the legal source search to provide **personalized analysis** of how each law specifically applies to the user's lease!

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### **The Old Way** ❌
```
1. Search for legal sources
2. Show statute text
3. Show generic explanation ("What This Means")
```

**Problem**: Generic explanation doesn't reference the user's actual lease.

### **The New Way** ✅
```
1. Search for legal sources
2. Show statute text
3. Use RAG to find relevant parts of the lease
4. Compare law with lease
5. Show personalized "How It Applies to Your Lease"
```

**Benefit**: Specific analysis using the user's actual lease terms!

## 🔍 The Process

### **Step 1: Find Legal Sources** (Existing)
- Search with OpenAI web search
- Fetch with Jina AI
- Verify with 4-layer verification
- Extract statute text

### **Step 2: Create RAG** (NEW!)
```typescript
// Extract text from user's PDF
const pageTexts = await extractTextWithPageNumbers(pdfBuffer);

// Create RAG system
const leaseRAG = await createLeaseRAG(pageTexts);
```

### **Step 3: Find Relevant Lease Clauses** (NEW!)
```typescript
// Query RAG for lease terms related to the law
const query = "Find lease terms related to: Security Deposits";
const relevantChunks = await leaseRAG.retrieveRelevant(query, 3);
```

**Example Output**:
- Chunk 1: "Security deposit: $1,200 due at signing..."
- Chunk 2: "Deposits are refundable upon..."
- Chunk 3: "Landlord will inspect within 30 days..."

### **Step 4: Compare Law with Lease** (NEW!)
```typescript
// Use GPT-4o to analyze how law applies
const analysis = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [{
    role: 'user',
    content: `
      LAW: Security deposits must be returned within 45 days
      
      LEASE TERMS:
      - Security Deposit: $1,200
      - Landlord will inspect within 30 days
      - Deposits are refundable
      
      How does this law apply to THIS tenant's lease?
    `
  }]
});
```

**Output**:
> "Your lease requires a $1,200 security deposit. Under Illinois law, your landlord must return it within 45 days after move-out. Your lease mentions a 30-day inspection period, which complies since it's shorter than the legal maximum."

---

## 📊 What Gets Analyzed

For each legal source, we analyze:

1. **The User's Lease Terms**
   - Monthly rent amount
   - Security deposit amount
   - Lease start/end dates
   - Specific clauses about the topic

2. **The Law Requirements**
   - What the statute says
   - Legal timeframes
   - Required conditions

3. **The Comparison**
   - Does lease comply with law?
   - Are there conflicts?
   - What does this mean for the user?

---

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Security Deposits** ✅

**Law Says**:
> "Landlord must return deposit within 45 days"

**Lease Says**:
> "Security deposit: $1,200. Refundable within 30 days."

**How It Applies to Your Lease**:
> "Your $1,200 security deposit must be returned within 30 days per your lease, which exceeds the 45-day legal requirement and is favorable to you."

---

### **Scenario 2: Notice Period** ⚠️

**Law Says**:
> "Tenant must give 30 days notice to terminate"

**Lease Says**:
> "Tenant must give 60 days notice to terminate"

**How It Applies to Your Lease**:
> "Your lease requires 60 days notice, which is MORE than the 30-day legal minimum. You must follow your lease's stricter requirement."

---

### **Scenario 3: Lease Silent** ℹ️

**Law Says**:
> "Landlord must maintain heating system"

**Lease Says**:
> (Nothing about heating)

**How It Applies to Your Lease**:
> "Your lease doesn't specifically mention heating, but Illinois law requires your landlord to maintain a functioning heating system. This law still protects you."

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### **"How It Applies to Your Lease" Box**

```tsx
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-50 to-blue-50">
  <p className="font-semibold">
    ✓ How It Applies to Your Lease
  </p>
  <p className="font-medium text-purple-900">
    {personalized analysis}
  </p>
</div>
```

**Features**:
- Gradient purple-to-blue background (vs. plain blue for generic)
- Checkmark icon (shows it's personalized)
- Bold text (emphasizes importance)
- Note if lease is silent on the topic

### **Fallback to Generic**

If RAG fails or no lease clauses found:
- Shows regular "What This Means" box
- Still provides generic explanation
- No personalization, but doesn't break

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test at**: http://localhost:3007

1. **Upload a lease PDF**
2. **Go to "Your Rights" section**
3. **Click "Find Legal Sources"** on any right
4. **Watch Console** for:
   ```
   🔍 Analyzing how laws apply to the lease with RAG...
   🔍 Analyzing how "Security Deposits" applies to the lease...
   ✅ Found 2 relevant lease sections
   ✅ Generated application analysis
   ✅ Successfully analyzed 3 law applications
   ```

5. **Check UI** for:
   - ✓ Purple/blue gradient box
   - ✓ "How It Applies to Your Lease" heading
   - ✓ Specific analysis mentioning lease terms
   - ✓ Uses actual $ amounts, dates from lease

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

### **Personalized Analysis Should**:
- ✅ Mention specific amounts from lease ($1,200 deposit)
- ✅ Reference specific dates (lease end: June 30, 2025)
- ✅ Compare lease terms with law requirements
- ✅ State if lease complies or conflicts
- ✅ Be under 50 words (concise)
- ✅ Use second person ("Your lease says...")

### **Examples of Good Analysis**:
✅ "Your $1,200 deposit must be returned within 45 days after your July 1, 2025 move-out date."
✅ "Your lease requires 60 days notice, which exceeds the 30-day legal minimum."
✅ "Your lease doesn't mention this, but the law still protects your rights."

### **Examples of Bad Analysis**:
❌ "Landlords must return deposits." (too generic)
❌ "The law requires..." (doesn't mention the lease)
❌ "Security deposits are important." (useless)

## 🔍 How RAG Finds Relevant Clauses

### **Query Example**:
```
"Find lease terms related to: Security Deposits"
```

### **RAG Process**:
1. Converts query to embedding
2. Searches all lease chunks for similar content
3. Returns top 3 most relevant chunks
4. Provides the actual text + page numbers

### **Example Results**:
```typescript
[
  {
    text: "SECURITY DEPOSIT. Tenant shall pay a security deposit of $1,200...",
    page: 3
  },
  {
    text: "Upon termination, Landlord will inspect and refund deposit within 30 days...",
    page 12
  },
  {
    text: "Deductions from deposit may be made for unpaid rent or damages...",
    page: 13
  }
]
```

### **LLM Analysis**:
Takes these 3 chunks + the law text + lease context → generates personalized explanation.
