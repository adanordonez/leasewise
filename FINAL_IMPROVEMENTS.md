# ✅ Final Improvements - Red Flags + Justia Sources

## 🎯 What Changed

### **1. Integrated RAG-Based Red Flags Analysis** 🚩

**New dedicated red flags analysis**:
- Uses RAG to search for problematic clauses in the lease
- Focused prompt specifically for red flag detection
- Only flags GENUINELY problematic issues (not standard terms)
- Rates severity: HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- Quotes exact problematic text from lease

**How it works**:
```
1. RAG searches for 8 types of problematic clauses:
   - Excessive fees/penalties
   - Unusual restrictions
   - Improper entry rights
   - Unfair repair liability
   - Security deposit issues
   - Termination issues
   - Hidden costs
   - Liability waivers

2. GPT-4o analyzes each clause
   - Only flags if GENUINELY problematic
   - Explains why it's unfair
   - Quotes exact text
   - Rates severity

3. Returns accurate, focused red flags
```

## 🔍 Red Flags Analysis - Technical Details

### **Old System**:
```
- Generic prompt in main analysis
- No RAG searching
- Often flagged standard terms
- Less focused
- Mixed with other analysis
```

### **New System**:
```
✅ Dedicated function: analyzeRedFlagsWithRAG()
✅ RAG searches 8 specific problem areas
✅ Focused prompt: "ONLY flag GENUINE problems"
✅ Quotes exact problematic text
✅ Severity ratings (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
✅ Separate from main analysis
```

### **Example Output**:

**Bad Clause Found**:
```json
{
  "issue": "Excessive Late Fee",
  "severity": "high",
  "explanation": "Late fee of $150 exceeds state limit of 10% of rent ($120). This is likely illegal.",
  "source": "Late fees shall be $150 per day for any rent payment received after the 5th",
  "page_number": 3
}
```

**Standard Clause (NOT flagged)**:
```
"Security deposit shall not exceed 2 months rent"
→ Not flagged (this is standard and legal)
```
