# ✅ Missing File Fixed

## Issue
The `KnowYourRightsLargeIcon.tsx` file was missing, causing a build error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve './KnowYourRightsLargeIcon'
```

## Solution
✅ **Recreated the file**: `components/KnowYourRightsLargeIcon.tsx`

The file now contains an animated SVG icon showing:
- 🛡️ Shield (representing protection/rights)
- ✓ Checkmark (animated)
- 📄 Legal document
- 📚 Law book with § symbol
- ⚖️ Gavel
- ✨ Sparkle effects

## What to Do

### If dev server is running:
The file should auto-reload and the error will disappear.

### If dev server is not running:
```bash
cd leasewise-app
npm run dev
```

The import error should be resolved and the app should compile successfully.

## Verification
File created at:
- Path: `components/KnowYourRightsLargeIcon.tsx`
- Size: ~4KB
- Status: ✅ Created

Used in:
- `components/LeaseWiseApp.tsx` (2 instances)
  - "Know Your Rights" feature section (desktop)
  - "Know Your Rights" feature section (mobile)

## Next Steps
The app should now:
1. ✅ Compile without errors
2. ✅ Display the "Know Your Rights" icon in the features section
3. ✅ Ready for testing the page numbers and PDF highlighting features

**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Impact**: Build error resolved  
**Action Required**: Restart dev server if needed
