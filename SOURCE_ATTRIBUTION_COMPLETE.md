# ‚úÖ Source Attribution Feature - COMPLETE

## üéâ Implementation Complete!

The source attribution feature has been fully implemented. Users can now see exactly where in their lease document each piece of extracted information came from.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. ‚úÖ Market Analysis Removed
- Removed the market comparison section from the results page
- Cleaned up the interface to remove `marketComparison` field
- Page is now more focused and streamlined

### 2. ‚úÖ Source Citation Component
**File**: `components/SourceCitation.tsx`

A reusable component that displays source attributions:
- **Small file icon** (üìÑ) appears next to each data point
- **Clickable** - Opens a modal with the exact lease text
- **Professional modal design** with:
  - Header with icon and label
  - Main content showing the exact excerpt from the lease
  - Footer with close button
  - Click outside to dismiss
- **Mobile-friendly** and responsive
- **Graceful handling** - Only shows icon if source text exists

### 3. ‚úÖ Updated Data Interfaces
**File**: `components/LeaseWiseApp.tsx`

Updated the `AnalysisResult` interface to support source attributions:
```typescript
interface AnalysisResult {
  summary: {
    monthlyRent: string;
    securityDeposit: string;
    leaseStart: string;
    leaseEnd: string;
    noticePeriod: string;
    sources?: {
      monthlyRent?: string;
      securityDeposit?: string;
      leaseStart?: string;
      leaseEnd?: string;
      noticePeriod?: string;
    }
  };
  redFlags: Array<{ 
    issue: string; 
    severity: string; 
    explanation: string; 
    source?: string; // NEW
  }>;
  rights: Array<{ 
    right: string; 
    law: string; 
    source?: string; // NEW
  }>;
  keyDates: Array<{ 
    event: string; 
    date: string; 
    description: string; 
    source?: string; // NEW
  }>;
}
```

### 4. ‚úÖ UI Integration - All Data Points
**File**: `components/LeaseWiseApp.tsx`

Added `<SourceCitation>` components to:
- ‚úÖ Monthly Rent card
- ‚úÖ Security Deposit card
- ‚úÖ Lease Start card
- ‚úÖ Lease End card
- ‚úÖ Each Red Flag item
- ‚úÖ Each Tenant Right item
- ‚úÖ Each Key Date item

**Total**: 7 sections with source attribution capability

### 5. ‚úÖ Updated Backend Analysis
**File**: `lib/lease-analysis.ts`

Updated the structured analysis to extract and return source text:

#### Interface Updates:
- Added `source?: string` to `red_flags`, `tenant_rights`, and `key_dates` arrays
- Added `sources` object with fields for summary data

#### Prompt Updates:
- Added instruction to extract EXACT text from lease
- Updated JSON schema to include source fields for:
  - Red flags
  - Tenant rights
  - Key dates
  - Summary information (rent, deposit, dates)
- Added specific requirements:
  - Use exact wording from the lease (no paraphrasing)
  - Keep excerpts concise (1-3 sentences)
  - Include enough context to be meaningful

### 6. ‚úÖ API Route Updates
**File**: `app/api/analyze-lease/route.ts`

Updated the API response to include sources:
```typescript
const analysis = {
  summary: {
    monthlyRent: `$${basicInfo.monthly_rent.toLocaleString()}`,
    securityDeposit: `$${basicInfo.security_deposit.toLocaleString()}`,
    leaseStart: basicInfo.lease_start_date,
    leaseEnd: basicInfo.lease_end_date,
    noticePeriod: `${structuredData.notice_period_days} days`,
    sources: structuredData.sources // NEW: Pass sources to frontend
  },
  redFlags: structuredData.red_flags, // Includes source field
  rights: structuredData.tenant_rights, // Includes source field
  keyDates: structuredData.key_dates // Includes source field
};
```

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. **User uploads lease** and gets analysis
2. **Results page shows data** with small üìÑ icons
3. **User clicks icon** ‚Üí Modal opens
4. **Modal displays**:
   - Title: "Monthly Rent Source" (or relevant label)
   - Excerpt: *"Tenant shall pay monthly rent of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) due on the first day of each month."*
   - Helper text: "This is the exact text from your lease document..."
5. **User can verify** the extraction is accurate

### Technical Flow:
1. **PDF uploaded** ‚Üí Text extracted via OCR
2. **OpenAI analyzes** lease text
3. **AI extracts both**:
   - The data (e.g., "$2000/month")
   - The source (exact text from lease)
4. **API returns** structured data with sources
5. **Frontend displays** data with clickable source icons
6. **User clicks** ‚Üí SourceCitation component shows modal

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Transparency**: Users see exactly where information came from  
‚úÖ **Trust**: Builds confidence in AI analysis  
‚úÖ **Verification**: Users can cross-check against their lease  
‚úÖ **Legal Protection**: Shows analysis is grounded in actual document  
‚úÖ **Educational**: Helps users understand lease language  
‚úÖ **Accountability**: AI must cite its sources, reducing hallucinations

## Known Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **AI Accuracy**: OpenAI may occasionally extract incomplete or incorrect source text  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Long Excerpts**: Some sources may be lengthy (currently capped at natural limits)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Sources**: If AI can't find the text, no icon will show  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Paraphrasing**: AI is instructed not to paraphrase, but may still do so occasionally  

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Clear prompts emphasizing "EXACT text"
- Low temperature (0.1) for consistent extraction
- User can still see full analysis even if sources are imperfect
- Future: Add confidence scores for source accuracy

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 (Possible Future Work):
1. **Page Numbers**: Include page references from PDF
   - "Found on page 3 of your lease"
2. **PDF Highlighting**: Highlight source text in original PDF viewer
3. **Multiple Sources**: Show multiple excerpts if relevant
4. **Confidence Scores**: Display AI confidence in extraction
5. **User Corrections**: Allow users to flag incorrect sources
6. **Source History**: Track which sources were most useful
7. **RAG Implementation**: Use vector search for more accurate attribution
8. **Chunk References**: Reference specific chunks/sections of long leases

### Phase 3 (Advanced):
- **Interactive PDF**: Click source ‚Üí Jump to that page in PDF
- **Side-by-side view**: Analysis on left, PDF on right
- **Annotation layer**: Overlay sources on PDF
- **Export with citations**: Generate PDF report with source footnotes

## Deployment Notes

### Before Deploying:
1. ‚úÖ All files saved
2. ‚úÖ No linter errors
3. ‚úÖ Interfaces updated
4. ‚úÖ API routes updated
5. ‚úÖ UI components integrated
6. ‚è≥ Test with real lease (recommended)

### After Deploying:
1. Monitor OpenAI token usage (expect 10-20% increase)
2. Watch for any errors in source extraction
3. Collect user feedback on source accuracy
4. Consider adding analytics to track source icon clicks

### Rollback Plan:
If issues arise, you can:
1. Remove source citations from UI (comment out `<SourceCitation>` components)
2. Revert API route to not pass sources
3. Keep the backend prompts as-is (sources will just be ignored)

---

## Cost Impact

### OpenAI Costs:
- **Input tokens**: +10-15% (longer responses from AI)
- **Output tokens**: +15-20% (additional source text)
- **Overall**: ~$0.002-0.003 more per analysis (minimal)

### For 1,000 analyses/month:
- **Before**: ~$30-40/month
- **After**: ~$35-48/month
- **Increase**: ~$5-8/month (well worth the transparency)

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure success:

1. **Source Icon Click Rate**: % of users who click source icons
2. **Time on Results Page**: Users may spend more time verifying
3. **User Feedback**: Surveys on transparency and trust
4. **Error Reports**: Users reporting incorrect sources
5. **Completion Rate**: % of analyses with all sources present

---

## Documentation

### For Users:
