  const prompt = `You are an expert tenant advocate analyzing a residential lease for genuinely problematic clauses.

YOUR TASK: Identify ONLY clauses that are ACTUALLY problematic, unfair, or unreasonable based on what's written in THIS lease.

LEASE CONTEXT:
- Monthly Rent: ${leaseContext.monthlyRent || 'Not specified'}
- Security Deposit: ${leaseContext.securityDeposit || 'Not specified'}
- Property Location: ${leaseContext.address || 'Not specified'}

POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC CLAUSES FROM THIS LEASE:
${uniqueChunks.map((chunk, i) => `
[Clause ${i + 1}] (Page ${chunk.pageNumber})
${chunk.text}
---`).join('\n')}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ONLY flag clauses based on what's actually written in the lease text above
2. DO NOT reference or assume state/local laws - analyze based on fairness and reasonableness
3. DO NOT flag if it's a standard, reasonable lease term
4. ONLY flag if the clause is clearly unfair, excessive, or one-sided against the tenant

WHAT TO FLAG (with examples):
- Excessive fees: Late fee of $500/day, cleaning fees of $1000+
- Unreasonable restrictions: No guests ever, no cooking certain foods
- Unfair liability: Tenant responsible for ALL damages including natural disasters
- Unreasonable entry: Landlord can enter anytime without notice for any reason
- Excessive penalties: Forfeiture of entire deposit for minor issues
- Rights waivers: Tenant waives right to sue, habitability rights, etc.

WHAT NOT TO FLAG (these are standard):
- Rent due on 1st of month
- Standard late fees ($50-75 or 5% of rent)
- Reasonable security deposits (1-2 months rent)
- Normal noise/behavior rules
- No pets or standard pet deposits
- Reasonable move-out cleaning requirements
- Standard 24-48 hour entry notice for non-emergency repairs

RATING SEVERITY:
- HIGH: Clearly unreasonable, excessive, or grossly unfair (e.g., $500 late fee after 1 day)
- MEDIUM: Unfair but seen in leases, disadvantages tenant significantly
- LOW: Potentially problematic depending on context, may be negotiable

EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS:
- State WHAT the clause says (quote key parts)
- Explain WHY it's problematic using specific numbers/details from the clause
- Compare to what would be reasonable (e.g., "This $500 late fee is excessive compared to typical $50-75 fees")
- DO NOT cite specific laws - focus on fairness and reasonableness
- Use the COMPLETE chunk text as the source${languageInstruction}

Return JSON:

  "redFlags": [
    {
      "issue": "Brief, specific title referencing the actual problem",
      "severity": "high" | "medium" | "low",
      "explanation": "Quote the problematic part, explain why it's unfair with specific details, note what would be more reasonable. Be specific about amounts/terms from the clause.",
      "source": "The COMPLETE chunk text from above (entire [Clause X] text block)",
      "page_number": page number,
      "chunk_index": "Clause 1, Clause 2, etc"
    }
  ]
}

If NO red flags found, return: {"redFlags": []}

IMPORTANT: Be conservative. Only flag clear problems. When in doubt, don't flag it.`;
