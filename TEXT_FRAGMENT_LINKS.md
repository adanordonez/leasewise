# 🔗 Text Fragment Links - Scroll to Exact Text

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

I've implemented two critical fixes:

### **1. Text Fragment URLs** (Like Google!)
When users click "View Exact Text in Source", the link now includes a **text fragment** that:
- ✅ Scrolls directly to the statute text on the page
- ✅ Highlights the text in yellow (browser feature)
- ✅ Works exactly like Google's "scroll to text" feature

### **2. Verification Fields Passed to UI**
Fixed the API to pass all verification data to the frontend:
- ✅ `isVerified`
- ✅ `verificationConfidence`
- ✅ `shouldShowLink`
- ✅ `shouldShowStatute`
- ✅ `statuteNumber`

Now the UI will actually show the verification badges and conditional rendering!

## 🔗 How Text Fragment Links Work

### **Example URL**

**Before**:
```
https://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2201
```

**After** (with text fragment):
```
https://ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=2201#:~:text=A%20lessor%20of%20residential%20real%20property...must%20return%20the%20tenant's%20security%20deposit%20within%2045%20days
```

### **What Happens**

1. Page loads normally
2. Browser searches for the text in the fragment
3. Scrolls to that exact location
4. **Highlights the text in yellow** (browser feature!)
5. User sees exactly what we quoted

---

## 🎯 User Experience

### **Before** ❌
- User clicks link → page loads
- User has to manually search for statute
- Page might be 50+ pages long
- User doesn't know if text exists
- Frustrating experience

### **After** ✅
- User clicks "View Exact Text in Source"
- Page loads AND scrolls to exact text
- **Text is highlighted in yellow**
- User sees exactly what we quoted
- Confirms we're not making it up!

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Files Modified**

1. **`lib/url-text-fragment.ts`** (NEW)
   - Creates text fragment URLs
   - Encodes text for URL
   - Extracts best text snippet for fragment

2. **`lib/legal-search.ts`** (FIXED)
   - Now passes verification fields to frontend
   - Includes: `isVerified`, `shouldShowLink`, `shouldShowStatute`, etc.

3. **`components/EnhancedLegalSources.tsx`** (UPDATED)
   - Uses text fragment URLs for all links
   - Shows verification badges
   - Conditional rendering based on verification

---

## 📝 Text Fragment Format

### **Basic Format**
```
#:~:text=text%20to%20find
```

### **What We Extract**

We use the **first 200 characters** of the statute text, focusing on:
- Statute number if available (e.g., "765 ILCS 715/1")
- 50 chars before + 150 chars after statute number
- Or just first 200 chars of statute text

### **Why This Works**

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari) support text fragments
- Standard web feature (part of URL spec)
- No JavaScript needed - browser does it
- Works even if page layout changes
- Highlights text in yellow automatically
