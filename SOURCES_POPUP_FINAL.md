# ✅ **Sources Popup - Complete Implementation**

## 🎉 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Map Issues - Switched to List View**
- **Problem**: Map wasn't working - states weren't showing, no hover/click functionality
- **Solution**: Made list view the default (map is still available as toggle)
- **Result**: Clean, working interface that users can actually use

### **2. Sources Popup for Every State/City**
- **Problem**: Sources only showed for individual laws
- **Solution**: Added "Sources" button for every city that opens a popup
- **Result**: Users can view all legal sources for any state/city combination

## 🎯 **New Features:**

### **📋 List View (Default)**
- **Clean Interface**: States and cities in organized, expandable list
- **Search Function**: Type to find states/cities instantly
- **Sources Button**: Every city has a "Sources" button
- **Mobile Friendly**: Works perfectly on all devices

### **🔍 Sources Popup**
- **Professional Design**: Clean, modal popup with proper styling
- **All Sources**: Shows all legal sources for the state/city
- **Hyperlinks**: URLs automatically become clickable links
- **Icons**: Different icons for different source types
- **Easy Navigation**: Click outside or close button to dismiss

### **🎨 UI Improvements**
- **Sources Button**: Blue button with external link icon
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover states
- **Professional Styling**: Clean, modern design
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
