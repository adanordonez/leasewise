# 🔒 Mapbox API Key Security Update

## ✅ **SECURED!** Mapbox API Key Now Server-Side Only

### **What Changed** 🔄

**Before (Insecure):**
- ❌ `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` - Exposed to client-side
- ❌ API key visible in browser network tab
- ❌ Users could inspect and steal your API key

**After (Secure):**
- ✅ `MAPBOX_TOKEN` - Server-side only (no NEXT_PUBLIC_)
- ✅ All geocoding requests go through your server
- ✅ API key never exposed to client-side
- ✅ Token only sent to client for map initialization (designed for this)

---

### **Environment Variables Update** 🔧

**1. Update your `.env.local` file:**

```bash
# REMOVE this line (insecure):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token

# ADD this line (secure):
MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token
```

**2. Update your Vercel environment variables:**

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
4. **Remove:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`
5. **Add:** `MAPBOX_TOKEN` with your Mapbox token value

---

### **How It Works Now** ⚙️

**1. Server-Side Geocoding:**
- ✅ All address searches go through `/api/geocode`
- ✅ Server makes requests to Mapbox API
- ✅ Client never sees the API key

**2. Map Initialization:**
- ✅ Map still needs token for rendering
- ✅ Token fetched from `/api/mapbox-token`
- ✅ This is safe - Mapbox tokens are designed for client use

**3. Security Benefits:**
- ✅ API key hidden from network inspection
- ✅ Rate limiting controlled by your server
- ✅ Can add additional security measures
- ✅ Can monitor and log API usage

---

### **Files Updated** 📁

**New API Routes:**
- ✅ `app/api/geocode/route.ts` - Server-side geocoding
- ✅ `app/api/mapbox-token/route.ts` - Token for map initialization

**Updated Components:**
- ✅ `components/AddressAutocomplete.tsx` - Uses server-side geocoding
- ✅ `components/DashboardMapboxMap.tsx` - Uses server-side geocoding
- ✅ `components/MapboxMapInner.tsx` - Uses server-side geocoding
- ✅ `components/MapboxMap.tsx` - Uses server-side token

---

### **Testing** 🧪

**1. Test Address Autocomplete:**
- ✅ Type an address in the analyze page
- ✅ Should show suggestions without exposing API key
- ✅ Check browser network tab - no direct Mapbox calls

**2. Test Dashboard Map:**
- ✅ Should load with lease locations
- ✅ Geocoding should work for all addresses
- ✅ No API key visible in network requests

**3. Test Laws Map:**
- ✅ Should load interactive US map
- ✅ State selection should work
- ✅ No API key visible in network requests

---

### **Security Verification** 🔍

**Check that API key is hidden:**

1. **Open browser DevTools**
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Use the app (search addresses, view maps)**
4. **Look for requests to:**
   - ✅ `api.mapbox.com` - Should NOT appear
   - ✅ `/api/geocode` - Should appear (your server)
   - ✅ `/api/mapbox-token` - Should appear (your server)

**If you see direct `api.mapbox.com` calls, the update didn't work properly.**

### **Benefits** ✨

**1. Security:**
- ✅ API key completely hidden from users
- ✅ No risk of key theft or abuse
- ✅ Full control over API usage

**2. Performance:**
- ✅ Can add caching to reduce API calls
- ✅ Can add rate limiting
- ✅ Can monitor usage patterns

**3. Control:**
- ✅ Can add authentication to geocoding
- ✅ Can log all address searches
- ✅ Can add custom business logic

### **Migration Checklist** ✅

- [ ] Update `.env.local` with `MAPBOX_TOKEN`
- [ ] Update Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Remove `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` from all environments
- [ ] Test address autocomplete
- [ ] Test dashboard map

**Your Mapbox API key is now completely secure!** 🔒✨

Users can no longer see or steal your API key, and all geocoding requests are properly secured through your server.
