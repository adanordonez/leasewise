# ✅ **Laws Section UI and Sources Fixed**

## 🎯 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Sources Not Showing Up**
**❌ Problem:**
- Sources weren't appearing even though they were in the database
- API was using `inner` join which only returned laws with matching sources

**✅ Solution:**
- **Changed** `law_sources!inner` to `law_sources` in the API query
- **This creates a left join** instead of inner join, so all laws are returned with their sources when available
- **Sources now display** for all state/city combinations that have them

### **2. States Organization - Large Cards to Small Tabs**
**❌ Problem:**
- States were displayed as large cards that required scrolling
- Not easy to see all available states at once

**✅ Solution:**
- **Replaced large state cards** with compact tab-style buttons
- **Added state tabs** at the top showing all states with city counts
- **Compact design** allows users to see all states without scrolling
- **Active state highlighting** with blue background for selected states

## 🔧 **Technical Changes:**

### **API Fix (`app/api/laws/route.ts`):**
```typescript
// Before (inner join - only laws with sources)
law_sources!inner (

// After (left join - all laws with sources when available)
law_sources (
```

### **UI Redesign (`app/laws/page.tsx`):**

**New State Tabs:**
```tsx
{/* States Tabs */}
<div className="mb-8">
  <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 mb-6">
    {Object.keys(groupedLaws).sort().map(state => (
      <button
        key={state}
        onClick={() => toggleState(state)}
        className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-lg text-sm font-medium transition-colors ${
          expandedStates.has(state)
            ? 'bg-blue-600 text-white shadow-md'
            : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-200'
        }`}
      >
        {state}
        <span className="ml-2 text-xs opacity-75">
          ({Object.keys(groupedLaws[state]).length})
        </span>
      </button>
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Compact State Display:**
- **Smaller state sections** with clean headers
- **City counts** displayed in tabs
- **Better organization** with indented topics
- **Sources buttons** for each city

## 🎉 **Result:**

**Sources Now Work:**
- ✅ **All laws display** regardless of whether they have sources
- ✅ **Sources appear** for state/city combinations that have them
- ✅ **Sources popup** works correctly for each city

**Better State Organization:**
- ✅ **Compact tabs** show all states at once
- ✅ **No scrolling required** to see all available states
- ✅ **City counts** displayed in each tab
- ✅ **Active state highlighting** for better UX
- ✅ **Clean, organized layout** for topics and laws

**Perfect solution for both issues!** ✨
