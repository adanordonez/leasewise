# Tenant-Friendly Laws Section Improvements

## ✅ Changes Made

I've reorganized the laws section to be more accessible for tenants who don't know their rights, while keeping all your existing database content intact.

### **1. Friendlier Page Title**

**Before:**
```
United States Landlord-Tenant Laws
Showing 44 topics • 1000 total laws
```

**After:**
```
Know Your Rights in New York
Find answers about your rights as a tenant • 1000 laws available
```

**Why:** Puts tenants first, emphasizes "rights" not "laws"

---

### **2. Helper/Guidance Box**

Added a blue info box that explains how to use the page:

```
💡 How to use this page

Browse topics below or search for a specific issue. 
Each topic shows your rights and what landlords 
must do in New York.
```

**Why:** Reduces confusion, guides new users

---

### **3. Better Search Placeholder**

**Before:**
```
Filter codes by name, year or publication
```

**After:**
```
Search for your situation... 
(e.g., 'security deposit', 'repairs', 'eviction')
```

**Why:** 
- Uses tenant language ("situation" not "codes")
- Provides concrete examples
- Makes it clear what to search for

---

### **4. Topic Descriptions**

Added tenant-friendly descriptions to each topic card:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Security Deposits** | Getting your deposit back, limits on charges, and deductions |
| **Lease Termination** | Breaking your lease early, notice requirements, and moving out |
| **Rent** | Rent increases, late fees, and payment requirements |
| **Maintenance** | Repairs, unsafe conditions, and landlord responsibilities |
| **Utilities** | Heat, water, electricity, and utility shut-offs |
| **Fire Safety** | Smoke detectors, fire escapes, and safety requirements |

**Why:** 
- Explains what each topic covers
- Uses everyday language
- Helps tenants find the right category

---

### **5. Updated Card Display**

**Before:**
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│ [🛡️] Security Deposits │
│      23 laws • 23 cities│
└────────────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [🛡️] Security Deposits                │
│      Getting your deposit back,       │
│      limits on charges, and deductions│
│      23 laws • 23 locations          │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why:** 
- Immediately tells tenants what they'll learn
- Uses "locations" instead of "cities" (clearer)
- More scannable

---

## 🎨 Visual Improvements

### **Better Information Hierarchy**

1. **State-specific title** (e.g., "Know Your Rights in New York")
2. **Guidance box** with helpful context
3. **Search box** with examples
4. **Topic cards** with clear descriptions

### **Consistent Language**

Replaced technical terms with tenant-friendly language:
- ❌ "Landlord-Tenant Laws" → ✅ "Know Your Rights"
- ❌ "Filter codes" → ✅ "Search for your situation"
- ❌ "Topics" → ✅ "Your rights as a tenant"
- ❌ "Cities" → ✅ "Locations"
